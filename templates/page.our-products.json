The “weight level” is a result of the amount of fill that is used in making the comforter. These levels are sometimes also identified with seasonality designations, i.e., Summer Weight, Year-Round, or Winter Weight, although these terms may be misleading in today’s climate-controlled\/air-conditioned world. Ultra-Light Weight—xx, Light Weight — ideal for warm climates, warmer bedrooms, or cool summer nights. Medium Weight — ideal for most climates, cool nights or temperature controlled bedrooms. Ultra Weight — thick and fluffy, designed for cold climates or for those who prefer little to no heat in their bedrooms.<\/p>"

It is nature's finest insulator and is a brilliant way of keeping these birds warm in frozen climates. Unlike feathers, which are flat and 2-dimensional, down clusters are structured somewhat like 3 dimensional snowflakes with dozens of soft, fine filaments. Scandia Down(r) only uses premium down from mature birds that have superior down clusters. As the filaments \"loft\" (expand and fluff), they create thousands of tiny warmth pockets, trapping air and body heat, keeping you comfortable and making our down luxuriously lightweight. We also use the largest clusters from the goose, which better interlock and overlap to trap a protective layer of air that keeps warmth in and cold out.<\/p>"

            "content": "<p>Fill power is a measure of the loft or \"fluffiness\" of a down clusters. High fill power down gives you more warmth with much less weight. Higher fill powers are also associated with a larger percentage of down clusters and a larger average down cluster size. The larger the cluster, the greater the loft. More loft creates more warmth since the more air an ounce of the down traps, the more insulating ability it will have. As a general guide, within the industry, 500 fill-power is considered average and 800 fill-power, sublime. At Scandia Home we offer the highest of quality in natural down fills ranging from 600 to nearly 900 for the highest of quality goose down. <\/p>"
