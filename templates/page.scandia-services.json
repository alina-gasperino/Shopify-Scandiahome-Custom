The Scandia Down Limited Warranty is your assurance of our quality commitment.<br\/><br\/>The warranty covers you, the original consumer from the date of your purchase or your receipt of this items and it lasts for as long as you own this item, unless it becomes void as described below. The Scandia Home Limited warranty covers all defects in materials (other than the natural filling material) and craftsmanship or malfunction of the product’s ticking (i.e. covering) on our down-filled comforters, pillows and foundations.<br\/><br\/>As use of the product over a period of years may diminish the loft of the filling material, as this is a natural product, this warranty does not extend to the filling material. Also, improper use or incorrect cleaning will also void this warranty and end the coverage.<br\/><br\/>To ensure warranty coverage continues, always keep the product in a protective covering (pillow protector or duvet cover) during use. Also, while necessary or desirable cleaning of your Scandia Down product can be performed by any professional cleaner but we recommend you use only an authorized Scandia Down dealer.<br\/><br\/>If this item is found to be defective by our Customer Service department during warranty coverage because of imperfect workmanship or imperfect ticking, it will be replaced with an item of equal or greater value, at our option.<\/p><p>Please contact 1-800-438-2431 to speak to one of our Customer Service agents in order to determine if an item is deemed defective.<\/p><p>If the item was purchased from an authorized Scandia Home store or Scandia Down dealer, simply bring or send it to your most conveniently located Scandia Home store or Scandia Down dealer with a detailed description of the problem.<br\/><br\/>Note:  Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This Warranty gives you specific legal rights.
